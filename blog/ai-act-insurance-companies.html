  <h1>Insurance Companies: Your Underwriting and Claims AI Is High-Risk Under the EU AI Act</h1>
  <p class="meta">February 2026 · 13 min read · <span style="background:var(--red-light);color:var(--red);padding:0.15rem 0.5rem;border-radius:4px;font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:600">HIGH-RISK · Industry Use Case</span></p>

  <p>If you are an insurance company, broker, or insurtech using AI for underwriting, risk pricing, or claims processing, the EU AI Act has you directly in its sights. Insurance AI is <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">explicitly listed as high-risk in Annex III, Category 5</a> — the same category that covers credit scoring, access to essential services, and financial decision-making that affects people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
  <p>This is not a grey area. AI used for risk assessment and pricing in life and health insurance is specifically named. The compliance requirements are substantial, and the deadline — <strong>August 2, 2026</strong> — leaves little room for delay.</p>

  <h2>What the AI Act Actually Says About Insurance</h2>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">Annex III, Category 5</a> covers AI systems used in access to and enjoyment of essential private services and essential public services and benefits. Two subcategories are directly relevant to insurance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5(b):</strong> AI systems intended to evaluate the creditworthiness of natural persons or establish their credit score, <em>with the exception of AI systems used for the purpose of detecting financial fraud</em></li>
    <li><strong>5(c):</strong> AI systems intended for risk assessment and pricing in relation to natural persons in the case of life and health insurance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This means: if your AI system determines whether someone gets insurance, how much they pay, or whether their claim is approved — and it affects life or health coverage — it is high-risk. The fraud detection exception in 5(b) is notable: AI used purely for fraud detection is not classified as high-risk under this category, though it still needs to operate within the law.</p>

  <h2>The AI Tools Insurance Companies Actually Use</h2>

  <h3>Claims Processing and Automation</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.lemonade.com" target="_blank">Lemonade</a></strong> is an AI-first insurance platform where 55% of claims are fully automated and 40% require zero human intervention. Their chatbot &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; uses dozens of anti-fraud algorithms and has processed a claim in as little as 2 seconds. This level of automation, while impressive, means Lemonade&rsquo;s AI is making decisions that directly affect policyholders&rsquo; access to insurance benefits.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://tractable.ai" target="_blank">Tractable</a></strong> uses computer vision to assess vehicle and property damage from photographs, handling approximately $2 billion worth of vehicle repairs annually and assisting over 1 million clients. Their AI provides damage estimates with certainty scores, enabling up to 10x reduction in claim resolution time.</p>

  <h3>Fraud Detection</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.shift-technology.com" target="_blank">Shift Technology</a></strong> offers an AI decision automation platform specifically for insurance fraud detection. Their &ldquo;Force&rdquo; platform achieves a 75% hit rate for fraud detection, identifies twice as much potential fraud as competitors, and has flagged over $5 billion in fraudulent claims. They serve approximately 100 customers across 25 countries, including Generali France and Mitsui Sumitomo.</p>
  <p>Importantly, fraud detection AI benefits from the <strong>Article 5(b) exception</strong> — it is not classified as high-risk under the creditworthiness category. However, if your fraud detection system also influences claim decisions or coverage eligibility, it may still be caught by Category 5(c).</p>

  <h3>Underwriting and Risk Pricing</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.zest.ai" target="_blank">Zest AI</a></strong> offers machine learning underwriting that uses 300+ data variables compared to the industry standard of approximately 20. They report a 20% average increase in approval rates with no added risk and up to 5x increase in automated approvals. While primarily focused on credit lending, their model management system applies to insurance underwriting as well.</p>
  <p>Core insurance platforms like <strong><a href="https://www.duckcreek.com" target="_blank">Duck Creek</a></strong> (200+ carriers globally) and <strong><a href="https://www.guidewire.com" target="_blank">Guidewire</a></strong> (450+ customers globally) increasingly embed AI for risk selection, pricing optimisation, and claims triage. Duck Creek has implemented AI testing protocols for algorithmic fairness in automated underwriting — a sign that the industry is already moving toward compliance.</p>

  <h3>Telematics and Usage-Based Insurance</h3>
  <p>AI-powered telematics analyse driving behaviour, health data from wearables, and IoT sensor data to personalise premiums. This data-intensive approach to pricing sits squarely within the high-risk classification because it directly determines what individuals pay for their insurance.</p>

  <h2>What You Are Required to Do</h2>
  <p>As an insurance company deploying high-risk AI, your obligations under <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-26" target="_blank">Article 26</a> are among the most demanding in the Act. Here is what is expected.</p>

  <h3>1. Conduct a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment</h3>
  <p>Before first use of high-risk AI in financial services, you must conduct a <strong>Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA)</strong>. This goes beyond a standard DPIA. You need to identify which demographic groups are likely to be affected, quantify disparate-impact ratios, evaluate privacy-intrusive features, and assess whether the AI system could result in discriminatory pricing or denial of essential coverage.</p>

  <h3>2. Ensure Human Oversight</h3>
  <p>High-risk AI systems must operate under meaningful human oversight. Assign trained personnel with the competence, training, and authority to oversee AI decisions. This means a qualified underwriter or claims handler must review AI-generated recommendations, especially for coverage denials, high-value claims, and unusual risk assessments. The AI assists your team — it does not replace their judgement.</p>

  <h3>3. Maintain Decision Logs</h3>
  <p>You must maintain logs automatically generated by the AI system for a <strong>minimum of 6 months</strong> (or longer as appropriate). These logs must allow full reconstruction of how the system reached specific decisions. This is critical for claims disputes, bias investigations, and regulatory inspections. If a customer challenges an AI-driven premium or claim decision, you need to be able to explain exactly how the system arrived at that result.</p>

  <h3>4. Inform Policyholders</h3>
  <p>You must inform individuals that they are subject to high-risk AI systems. This notification must happen before or during the decision-making process. Policyholders have the right to know that AI is involved in their underwriting, pricing, or claims assessment, and to understand what role it plays.</p>

  <h3>5. Ensure AI Literacy</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4" target="_blank">Article 4</a> requires that all personnel who build, operate, or use AI systems have role-based AI literacy training. Underwriters need to understand how the AI pricing model works. Claims handlers need to know when to override AI recommendations. Compliance officers need to understand the regulatory framework. This has been mandatory since February 2025.</p>

  <h3>6. Monitor for Bias and Discrimination</h3>
  <p>Insurance AI that determines pricing based on personal data carries inherent risks of discrimination. You must continuously monitor your AI systems for discriminatory outcomes across demographic groups, track approval and denial rates by protected characteristics, and document remediation of any discriminatory patterns identified.</p>

  <h3>7. Work With Your Technology Providers</h3>
  <p>If you use third-party AI platforms (Shift Technology, Tractable, Zest AI, Duck Creek, Guidewire), the heaviest technical obligations — risk management systems, conformity assessments, bias testing, technical documentation — fall on them as providers. But you need to verify they are preparing. Request their compliance documentation. Confirm their conformity assessment timelines. Ensure your contracts require them to support your compliance as a deployer.</p>

  <h2>Can You Handle This Yourself?</h2>
  <p>Insurance compliance is already heavily regulated (Solvency II, IDD, GDPR). Adding the AI Act creates another layer, but many of the concepts — risk management, documentation, governance, consumer protection — are familiar. The AI Act does introduce new requirements that may require specialist support:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducting Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (a new concept distinct from DPIAs)</li>
    <li>Algorithmic fairness testing and bias monitoring across demographic groups</li>
    <li>Interpreting whether specific AI tools qualify for the fraud detection exemption</li>
    <li>Preparing deployer documentation that satisfies both the AI Act and existing regulatory frameworks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For smaller brokers using one or two AI tools, the compliance effort is manageable with guidance. For larger insurers or insurtechs with AI embedded across underwriting, claims, and customer service, a dedicated AI governance programme is advisable.</p>

  <h2>What &ldquo;Compliant&rdquo; Looks Like for an Insurance Company</h2>
  <p>Consider a mid-sized insurer using Zest AI for underwriting, Tractable for claims damage assessment, Shift Technology for fraud detection, and a chatbot for customer service. Here is what compliance looks like by August 2026:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have documented every AI system in use, its purpose, and which Annex III Category 5 subcategory it falls under</li>
    <li>A Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment has been completed for all underwriting and pricing AI, identifying affected demographic groups and potential discriminatory outcomes</li>
    <li>Every AI-generated underwriting decision, premium calculation, and claim assessment is reviewed by a qualified human before becoming final — especially coverage denials</li>
    <li>Decision logs are maintained for at least 6 months, allowing full reconstruction of how AI reached each decision</li>
    <li>Policyholders are informed that AI is used in their underwriting, pricing, and claims processes, with clear explanations of its role</li>
    <li>All relevant staff have completed AI literacy training covering how the tools work, their limitations, and when to override</li>
    <li>You continuously monitor AI outputs for bias and discrimination, with documented processes for remediation</li>
    <li>Fraud detection AI (Shift Technology) is documented as exempt under Category 5(b), but monitored to ensure it does not indirectly influence coverage decisions</li>
    <li>Your customer service chatbot clearly discloses that users are interacting with AI</li>
    <li>You have verified your technology providers&rsquo; AI Act compliance roadmaps and have their documentation on file</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Penalties</h2>
  <p>Non-compliance with high-risk AI obligations can result in fines of up to <strong>&euro;15 million or 3% of global annual turnover</strong>, whichever is higher for large companies. For SMEs, the calculation uses whichever figure is lower. Insurance companies also face the usual regulatory risks: licence conditions, supervisory actions from national insurance authorities, and potential civil claims from policyholders affected by non-compliant AI decisions.</p>
  <p>The compounding effect is significant. An insurer using AI that discriminates in pricing could face AI Act fines, GDPR fines (for automated decision-making without proper safeguards under Article 22), and civil litigation from affected policyholders — simultaneously.</p>

  <h2>The Deadline</h2>
  <p>AI literacy requirements and prohibited practices have been in force since February 2025. The full high-risk system obligations under Annex III take effect on <strong>August 2, 2026</strong>. Insurance companies that have not started their AI governance programmes are working against a tight timeline. The complexity of insurance regulation means that layering AI Act compliance onto existing frameworks (Solvency II, IDD, GDPR) requires careful planning — starting now.</p>
