  <h1>Recruitment Agencies: Why Your AI Hiring Tools Are High-Risk Under the EU AI Act</h1>
  <p class="meta">February 2026 · 12 min read · <span style="background:var(--red-light);color:var(--red);padding:0.15rem 0.5rem;border-radius:4px;font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:600">HIGH-RISK · Industry Use Case</span></p>

  <p>If you run a recruitment agency and use any form of AI to screen CVs, score candidates, or automate parts of your hiring process, this article is important. Unlike most industries where the EU AI Act imposes light-touch obligations, recruitment AI is <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">explicitly listed as high-risk in Annex III</a> of the regulation.</p>
  <p>This is not a grey area. AI systems used to recruit, select, or evaluate candidates are specifically named. The compliance requirements are substantial, and the deadline — August 2, 2026 — is approaching quickly.</p>

  <h2>What the AI Act Actually Says About Recruitment</h2>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">Annex III, Category 4</a> of the AI Act classifies the following as high-risk:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI systems intended to be used for the <strong>recruitment or selection of natural persons</strong>, in particular to place targeted job advertisements, to analyse and filter job applications, and to evaluate candidates</li>
    <li>AI systems intended to make <strong>decisions affecting terms of work-related relationships</strong>, promotion, termination, task allocation based on individual behaviour or personal traits, or to monitor and evaluate performance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This covers a very wide range of tools that recruitment agencies use every day. If your software ranks candidates, filters applications, or makes any form of automated recommendation about who to progress, it almost certainly falls under this category.</p>
  <p>There is a narrow exception under <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-6" target="_blank">Article 6(3)</a>: AI systems that perform only "narrow procedural tasks" — for example, a tool that simply extracts contact details or graduation dates from a CV without ranking or recommending. But the moment that tool starts scoring, matching, or shortlisting, it crosses into high-risk territory.</p>

  <h2>The AI Tools Recruitment Agencies Actually Use</h2>
  <p>Most recruitment agencies are already using AI, whether they realise it or not. Here are the most common platforms and what their AI does:</p>

  <h3>CV Screening and Candidate Matching</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.manatal.com" target="_blank">Manatal</a></strong> (from $15/user/month) uses AI to parse CVs, score candidates against job requirements, enrich profiles with data from LinkedIn and other social platforms, and generate ranked shortlists. Their <a href="https://www.manatal.com/blog/ai-resume-screening" target="_blank">AI Recommendations feature</a> scans your entire database and produces scorecards of the most suitable candidates for each role. Manatal also offers an AI Interviewer that conducts automated screening around the clock.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://help.workable.com/hc/en-us/articles/23685011706775-Using-the-Screening-Assistant-AI-powered" target="_blank">Workable</a></strong> includes a Screening Assistant that uses semantic analysis to match candidates to job requirements. It generates profile summaries with a checklist showing how each candidate matches against the hard requirements, and ranks candidates based on AI evaluation. Workable also offers anonymised resume screening to reduce unconscious bias.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.zoho.com/recruit/ai-recruitment.html" target="_blank">Zoho Recruit</a></strong> uses Zia, Zoho's proprietary AI, to find best-suited candidates based on job requirements and skill sets, and provides AI-generated skill scores. Zia can also generate job descriptions, source candidates, and roll out offer letters.</p>

  <h3>Video Interviewing and Assessment</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.hirevue.com/ai-in-hiring" target="_blank">HireVue</a></strong> is one of the largest AI hiring platforms, offering AI-powered video assessments with detailed candidate scoring. HireVue uses generative AI with proprietary models for job matching and candidate assessment. The platform conducts regular third-party bias audits and has an AI ethics board overseeing development. Enterprise pricing starts at around $35,000 per year.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting that HireVue previously used facial analysis in video interviews — a practice that attracted significant scrutiny and was eventually discontinued. The EU AI Act now <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-5" target="_blank">explicitly prohibits</a> emotion recognition in workplace and recruitment contexts.</p>

  <h3>Other Common Tools</h3>
  <p>Platforms like <strong>Recruiterflow</strong>, <strong>Eightfold AI</strong>, <strong>Paradox</strong>, <strong>Phenom</strong>, and <strong>GoodTime (Orchestra)</strong> all use AI for candidate matching, automated outreach, interview scheduling, and sentiment analysis. Even widely used tools like <strong>LinkedIn Recruiter</strong> now incorporate AI-powered candidate recommendations and, as of early 2025, an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/linkedin-hiring-assistant" target="_blank">AI recruitment agent</a> for small businesses.</p>

  <h2>What You Are Required to Do</h2>
  <p>As a recruitment agency deploying high-risk AI, your obligations under <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-26" target="_blank">Article 26</a> are more significant than those of a business using minimal-risk AI. Here is what is expected of you:</p>

  <h3>1. Inform Candidates</h3>
  <p>You must tell candidates that AI is being used in the recruitment process, explain how the AI system functions, and clarify what role it plays in decision-making. Under both the AI Act and <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/" target="_blank">GDPR Article 22</a>, candidates have the right to request an explanation of automated decisions that significantly affect them.</p>

  <h3>2. Ensure Human Oversight</h3>
  <p>High-risk AI systems must operate under meaningful human oversight. This means a qualified person must review AI-generated shortlists, scores, and recommendations before they become hiring decisions. The AI should assist your recruiters, not replace their judgement.</p>

  <h3>3. Monitor the AI System</h3>
  <p>You are required to continuously monitor the operation of your AI tools following the instructions provided by the software provider. This includes watching for unexpected outputs, discriminatory patterns, or inaccurate results, and reporting any serious incidents.</p>

  <h3>4. Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment</h3>
  <p>Under <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/" target="_blank">GDPR Article 35</a>, deploying high-risk AI that processes personal data requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). This evaluates the potential impact on candidates' rights and freedoms and proposes mitigation measures. If you do not already have a DPIA for your AI hiring tools, you need one.</p>

  <h3>5. Ensure AI Literacy</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4" target="_blank">Article 4</a> requires that all staff involved in operating AI systems have sufficient AI literacy. Your recruiters need to understand how the AI tools work, what data they use, and where their limitations are. This has been mandatory since February 2025.</p>

  <h3>6. Work With Your Software Providers</h3>
  <p>The heaviest technical obligations — risk management systems, data governance, technical documentation, conformity assessments, CE marking, and EU database registration — fall on the <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16" target="_blank">providers</a> (the companies that build the AI). But you need to confirm that your providers are preparing for compliance. Ask them directly: are they conducting conformity assessments? Do they have technical documentation? Will they be ready by August 2026?</p>
  <p>Platforms like Manatal, Workable, and Zoho Recruit already advertise <a href="https://www.manatal.com/features/compliance" target="_blank">GDPR compliance features</a> and SOC 2 certification. But GDPR compliance alone does not satisfy AI Act requirements. The AI Act adds obligations around risk management, bias testing, and transparency that go beyond data protection.</p>

  <h2>Can You Handle This Yourself?</h2>
  <p>Partially. Some of the deployer obligations — informing candidates, ensuring human oversight, training your team — are things you can implement internally. But given that recruitment AI is explicitly high-risk, there are areas where professional guidance is advisable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducting a proper DPIA if you have not done one before</li>
    <li>Assessing whether your specific AI tools meet the Article 6(3) exemption criteria</li>
    <li>Reviewing your contracts with AI providers to ensure they are meeting their provider obligations</li>
    <li>Preparing documentation that demonstrates your compliance as a deployer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For a small recruitment agency using one or two AI tools, the compliance effort is manageable with some guidance. For larger agencies using multiple AI platforms across different jurisdictions, a specialist consultant is strongly recommended.</p>

  <h2>What "Compliant" Looks Like for a Recruitment Agency</h2>
  <p>Consider a mid-sized recruitment agency with 15 consultants, using Manatal for candidate screening and LinkedIn Recruiter for sourcing. Here is what compliance looks like by August 2026:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have documented which AI tools you use, their purpose, and confirmed they fall under Annex III Category 4</li>
    <li>Your candidate-facing communications clearly state that AI is used in the screening process, and explain how</li>
    <li>Every AI-generated shortlist and candidate score is reviewed by a human recruiter before any decision is made</li>
    <li>Your team has completed AI literacy training covering how Manatal's scoring works, what data it uses, and its known limitations</li>
    <li>You have completed a DPIA for your AI hiring tools, or engaged a data protection specialist to do so</li>
    <li>You have written to Manatal and LinkedIn confirming their AI Act compliance roadmap, and have their responses on file</li>
    <li>You have a process for candidates to request an explanation of how AI was used in their application</li>
    <li>You are monitoring the AI system's outputs for patterns of bias or inaccuracy, and documenting any issues</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is more work than what a hair salon or restaurant needs to do, and that is proportionate — AI that affects people's employment prospects carries real consequences, and the regulation reflects that.</p>

  <h2>The Penalties</h2>
  <p>Non-compliance with high-risk AI obligations can result in fines of up to <strong>&#x20AC;15 million or 3% of global annual turnover</strong>, whichever is higher. Separately, GDPR violations (such as failing to conduct a DPIA) can add fines of up to &#x20AC;20 million or 4% of turnover. These penalties can compound.</p>
  <p>But beyond fines, there is a reputational risk. Recruitment agencies operate on trust. If candidates or clients discover you are using AI without transparency or proper safeguards, the commercial damage may exceed any regulatory penalty.</p>

  <h2>The Deadline</h2>
  <p>The core obligations for high-risk AI systems under Annex III take effect on <strong>August 2, 2026</strong>. Compliance typically takes 8 to 14 months, which means agencies starting now are already working on a tight timeline. The AI literacy requirement under Article 4 has been in force since February 2025.</p>
