  <h1>Schools and Universities: Most of Your AI Is High-Risk Under the EU AI Act</h1>
  <p class="meta">February 2026 · 14 min read · <span style="background:var(--red-light);color:var(--red);padding:0.15rem 0.5rem;border-radius:4px;font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:600">HIGH-RISK · Industry Use Case</span></p>

  <p>If you run a school, college, or university and use AI in any part of student assessment, admissions, or learning, this article matters. Education AI is <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">explicitly listed as high-risk in Annex III, Category 3</a> of the EU AI Act — one of the most detailed high-risk categories in the entire regulation.</p>
  <p>This is not a future concern. The prohibition on emotion recognition in education took effect in February 2025. AI literacy obligations are already in force. The full high-risk compliance deadline is <strong>August 2, 2026</strong>.</p>

  <h2>What the AI Act Actually Says About Education</h2>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">Annex III, Category 3</a> lists four specific types of high-risk AI in education:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3(a):</strong> AI systems intended to determine access to or assign persons to educational institutions — admissions algorithms, placement testing AI</li>
    <li><strong>3(b):</strong> AI systems intended to evaluate learning outcomes, including those that steer the learning process — automated grading, adaptive learning platforms, learning analytics</li>
    <li><strong>3(c):</strong> AI systems intended to assess the appropriate level of education an individual will receive — systems that place students in remedial or advanced tracks</li>
    <li><strong>3(d):</strong> AI systems intended to monitor and detect prohibited behaviour during tests — proctoring software, plagiarism detection with AI analysis</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That covers almost everything. If your AI tool grades, ranks, monitors, recommends, or decides anything about a student&rsquo;s educational path, it is almost certainly high-risk.</p>
  <p>There is a narrow exception under <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-6" target="_blank">Article 6(3)</a> for AI that performs only &ldquo;narrow procedural tasks&rdquo; — for example, a tool that simply formats assignment submissions without scoring them. But the moment a system evaluates, ranks, or flags student work, it crosses into high-risk territory.</p>

  <h2>Emotion Recognition Is Banned in Schools</h2>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-5" target="_blank">Article 5(1)(f)</a> prohibits AI systems that infer emotions from biometric data in educational institutions. This has been in force since <strong>February 2, 2025</strong>.</p>
  <p>This means schools cannot use facial recognition to assess student attention, voice analysis to measure engagement, or any biometric system that attempts to read how students are feeling. The only exceptions are for medical or safety purposes — detecting a student in medical distress, for example.</p>
  <p>If you have any attention-monitoring or engagement-tracking tools that use facial or voice analysis, they need to be removed. Now.</p>

  <h2>The AI Tools Schools and Universities Actually Use</h2>
  <p>Most educational institutions are already using AI across multiple areas. Here are the most common tools and what their AI does.</p>

  <h3>Proctoring and Exam Monitoring</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://web.respondus.com/he/lockdownbrowser/" target="_blank">Respondus LockDown Browser &amp; Monitor</a></strong> restricts student access to other applications during online tests, while the Monitor add-on uses AI to analyse audio and video for suspicious activity. In February 2024, the Ontario Privacy Commissioner found that McMaster University&rsquo;s use of Respondus Monitor violated student privacy protections — the software was using student data to improve its system without consent.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.proctorio.com" target="_blank">Proctorio</a></strong> offers remote proctoring with AI-powered eye-tracking, behaviour monitoring, browser tab tracking, and video/audio recording. These monitoring capabilities place it squarely within Annex III, Category 3(d).</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.turnitin.com/products/examsoft" target="_blank">ExamSoft</a></strong> (a Turnitin subsidiary) provides secure online examinations with optional ExamMonitor and ExamID add-ons that use AI-driven behaviour detection during exams, including continuous audio and video recording with human review of flagged incidents.</p>

  <h3>Plagiarism Detection and AI Writing Detection</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.turnitin.com" target="_blank">Turnitin</a></strong> is the most widely used plagiarism detection platform in education. Its AI detection tool, Turnitin Clarity, identifies AI-generated content from models like ChatGPT and Claude. Pricing varies significantly — basic plagiarism detection costs $2.59–$2.71 per student, with AI detection as an add-on at $0.41–$0.48 per student. Pricing has been found to vary by up to 360% between institutions for the same service.</p>
  <p>Alternatives include <strong><a href="https://copyleaks.com" target="_blank">Copyleaks</a></strong> (99% AI detection accuracy across 30+ languages), <strong><a href="https://gptzero.me" target="_blank">GPTZero</a></strong> (purpose-built for educators), and <strong><a href="https://www.scribbr.com/plagiarism-checker/" target="_blank">Scribbr</a></strong> (uses the same database as Turnitin).</p>

  <h3>Adaptive Learning Platforms</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.century.tech" target="_blank">Century Tech</a></strong> uses AI, neuroscience, and learning science to create personalised learning pathways that constantly adapt to each student. Case studies report a 30% reduction in the attainment gap between disadvantaged students and their peers. This type of tool — AI that steers the learning process — falls directly under Annex III, Category 3(b).</p>
  <p><strong>Knewton</strong> (now integrated into major publishers like Pearson and Cengage) analyses student performance to create personalised learning paths. It identifies knowledge gaps and recommends content to close them. Again, this is AI evaluating and steering learning — high-risk by default.</p>

  <h3>Learning Management Systems with AI</h3>
  <p><strong>Canvas</strong> (by Instructure, which also owns Turnitin) is evolving into an AI-enabled learning hub with agentic AI features and modular add-ons. <strong>Blackboard</strong> (by Anthology) blends LMS, SIS, and CRM with embedded AI for personalised learning. <strong>D2L Brightspace</strong> offers Lumi Tutor, a student-facing AI tutor. Even <strong>Moodle</strong>, the open-source LMS, supports AI plugin integration.</p>
  <p>The risk classification of these platforms depends on how their AI features are used. If the AI merely organises content or schedules reminders, it is minimal risk. If it recommends learning paths, predicts student performance, or influences progression decisions, it is likely high-risk.</p>

  <h2>What You Are Required to Do</h2>
  <p>As a school or university deploying high-risk AI, your obligations under <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-26" target="_blank">Article 26</a> are substantial. Here is what is expected.</p>

  <h3>1. Audit Every AI Tool You Use</h3>
  <p>Create a complete inventory of every AI system in your institution. Document what it does, which Annex III category it falls under (3a, 3b, 3c, or 3d), who uses it, and what data it processes. Most institutions will be surprised by how many AI tools they are already running.</p>

  <h3>2. Remove Any Emotion Recognition Systems</h3>
  <p>If any of your tools attempt to infer student emotions from facial expressions, voice, or other biometric data, remove them immediately. This prohibition has been in force since February 2025. The only exception is medical or safety purposes.</p>

  <h3>3. Ensure Meaningful Human Oversight</h3>
  <p>High-risk AI systems in education must operate under meaningful human oversight. This means a qualified educator or administrator must review AI-generated grades, scores, admissions recommendations, and plagiarism flags before they become final decisions. The AI assists your staff — it does not replace their professional judgement.</p>

  <h3>4. Inform Students and Parents</h3>
  <p>You must tell students (and, where applicable, parents) that AI is being used in decisions that affect them. This includes explaining how proctoring software works, how plagiarism detection operates, how adaptive learning platforms make recommendations, and what role AI plays in admissions or grading.</p>

  <h3>5. Ensure AI Literacy Across Your Institution</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4" target="_blank">Article 4</a> requires that all staff involved in operating AI systems have sufficient AI literacy. Teachers using Turnitin need to understand how the AI detection works, what its false positive rate is, and when to override its results. Admissions staff using AI screening need to know its limitations. This obligation has been mandatory since February 2025.</p>

  <h3>6. Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments</h3>
  <p>Under <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/" target="_blank">GDPR Article 35</a>, deploying high-risk AI that processes student data — especially data from minors — requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Proctoring tools that record video and audio of students are particularly sensitive. If you do not have DPIAs for your AI tools, you need them.</p>

  <h3>7. Work With Your Software Providers</h3>
  <p>The heaviest technical obligations — risk management systems, conformity assessments, bias testing, CE marking — fall on the providers (the companies that build the AI). But you need to confirm your providers are preparing. Ask Turnitin, Proctorio, Century Tech, and every other AI vendor: are you conducting conformity assessments? Do you have technical documentation? Will you be ready by August 2026?</p>

  <h2>Can You Handle This Yourself?</h2>
  <p>Schools operate differently from businesses. Budget constraints are real, and compliance teams are rare. The good news is that most schools are <strong>deployers</strong>, not providers — you use existing AI tools rather than building your own. This significantly reduces your compliance burden.</p>
  <p>What you can do internally:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create your AI system inventory</li>
    <li>Implement transparency notices for students and parents</li>
    <li>Establish human review processes for AI-generated grades and flags</li>
    <li>Deliver AI literacy training to your staff</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Where you may need professional guidance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducting DPIAs for proctoring and assessment tools, especially those processing data from minors</li>
    <li>Reviewing contracts with AI providers to ensure they meet their provider obligations</li>
    <li>Assessing whether specific AI tools qualify for the Article 6(3) narrow procedural task exemption</li>
    <li>Preparing documentation that demonstrates compliance as a deployer</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What &ldquo;Compliant&rdquo; Looks Like for a School</h2>
  <p>Consider a secondary school with 800 students using Turnitin for plagiarism detection, an adaptive learning platform for maths, and an AI-assisted admissions screening tool. Here is what compliance looks like by August 2026:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have documented every AI tool in use, its purpose, and which Annex III Category 3 subcategory it falls under</li>
    <li>Any emotion recognition tools have been removed</li>
    <li>Students and parents have been informed that AI is used in assessments, plagiarism detection, and admissions screening, with clear explanations of how each system works</li>
    <li>Every AI-generated plagiarism flag is reviewed by a teacher before any academic misconduct decision is made</li>
    <li>Admissions recommendations generated by AI are reviewed by human admissions staff before any offer or rejection</li>
    <li>All teaching staff using AI tools have completed AI literacy training covering how the tools work, their limitations, and known error rates</li>
    <li>DPIAs have been completed for all AI tools processing student data, with particular attention to proctoring tools recording minors</li>
    <li>You have written to each AI vendor confirming their compliance roadmap and have their responses on file</li>
    <li>You monitor AI system outputs for patterns of bias or inaccuracy and document any issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Penalties</h2>
  <p>Non-compliance with high-risk AI obligations can result in fines of up to <strong>&euro;15 million or 3% of annual turnover</strong>. For SMEs, the calculation uses whichever figure is lower, not higher — a meaningful protection for smaller institutions. Using prohibited AI (like emotion recognition in classrooms) carries fines of up to <strong>&euro;35 million or 7% of turnover</strong>.</p>
  <p>But for schools, the reputational risk may matter more than fines. Parents trust schools with their children&rsquo;s data and educational outcomes. Being found to use AI without transparency, oversight, or proper safeguards would be damaging in ways that go well beyond a regulatory penalty.</p>

  <h2>The Deadline</h2>
  <p>The emotion recognition prohibition and AI literacy requirements are already in force. The full high-risk system obligations under Annex III take effect on <strong>August 2, 2026</strong>. Schools that have not started preparing are already behind. The good news: as a deployer rather than a provider, your compliance path is more manageable than you might expect — but it requires action now, not in six months.</p>
