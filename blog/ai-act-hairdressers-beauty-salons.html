  <h1>Does the EU AI Act Apply to My Hair Salon?</h1>
  <p class="meta">February 2026 · 10 min read · <span style="background:var(--gold-light);color:var(--gray-800);padding:0.15rem 0.5rem;border-radius:4px;font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:600">Industry Use Case</span></p>

  <p>You run a hair salon. You cut hair, mix colour, and keep clients coming back. You are not a tech company. So why would EU artificial intelligence regulation have anything to do with you?</p>
  <p>The short answer: if you use modern booking software, a virtual receptionist, or any tool that makes automated decisions about your clients, you are already using AI. And the EU AI Act, which comes fully into force in August 2026, applies to businesses that <strong>deploy</strong> AI systems — not just those that build them.</p>
  <p>Here is what you actually need to know.</p>

  <h2>The AI You Are Probably Already Using</h2>
  <p>Most salon owners do not think of their booking software as "artificial intelligence." But the tools that power modern salons are increasingly AI-driven. Here are the most common ones:</p>

  <h3>Booking and Scheduling Software</h3>
  <p><strong>Fresha</strong>, used by over 100,000 salons worldwide, now includes AI-powered <a href="https://www.fresha.com/blog/Up-Next-2026" target="_blank">"smart bookings"</a> that automatically optimise your calendar by shortening gaps between appointments. Their <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/freshas-ai-powered-defense-reduces-fraud-by-99-302377652.html" target="_blank">AI fraud detection system</a> uses machine learning to reduce fraudulent bookings by 99 percent. In 2026, Fresha is rolling out an <a href="https://www.fresha.com/blog/Up-Next-2026" target="_blank">AI receptionist</a> that answers client questions and handles bookings outside your working hours.</p>
  <p><strong>Booksy</strong> was one of the first beauty platforms to integrate with <a href="https://biz.booksy.com/en-us/blog/booksy-google-ai-mode-integration" target="_blank">Google AI Mode</a>, allowing clients to say "find me a hair salon for highlights this Saturday afternoon" and have Google's AI automatically match them with your real-time availability and complete the booking. Booksy also uses <a href="https://getzowie.com/testimonials/booksy" target="_blank">Zowie AI to handle 70 percent of customer service enquiries</a> automatically.</p>
  <p>Other popular platforms like <strong>Vagaro</strong>, <strong>GlossGenius</strong>, <strong>Boulevard</strong>, and <strong>Zenoti</strong> all incorporate some form of AI for scheduling optimisation, client recommendations, or automated communications.</p>

  <h3>AI Receptionists and Phone Handling</h3>
  <p>A growing number of salons use AI phone answering services. Tools like <strong>BookingBee</strong>, <strong>My AI Front Desk</strong>, <strong>GoodCall</strong>, and <strong>Qlient.ai</strong> answer calls 24/7, understand service-specific questions, book appointments, and handle cancellations — without a human picking up the phone.</p>

  <h3>AI Hair Colour Technology</h3>
  <p>Fresha recently <a href="https://theindustry.beauty/fresha-invests-in-ai-powered-hair-colour-technology-company-yuv/" target="_blank">invested in Yuv</a>, an AI-powered hair colour technology company. Yuv allows salons to save personalised hair colour formulas in client profiles, ensuring consistency across visits. Other companies offer virtual try-on tools where clients can see how a colour or style would look before committing.</p>

  <h3>AI Marketing and Client Retention</h3>
  <p>Many salon platforms now include AI-powered marketing: automated email campaigns with personalised product recommendations, smart segmentation that targets clients who have not visited recently, and dynamic messaging that adjusts based on client behaviour.</p>

  <h2>What Risk Level Does This Put You In?</h2>
  <p>The EU AI Act uses a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/rules-for-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-in-the-eu.html" target="_blank">four-tier risk classification</a>: prohibited, high-risk, limited risk, and minimal risk. The classification depends on the intended purpose of the AI system and the potential impact on people's fundamental rights. Here is where typical salon AI falls:</p>

  </table>

  <p><strong>The good news:</strong> most salon AI falls into the minimal or limited risk categories. You are not facing the same compliance burden as a bank using AI for credit scoring or a hospital using AI for diagnostics.</p>
  <p><strong>The important caveat:</strong> if you use any AI tool that interacts directly with clients — an AI receptionist, a chatbot, Google AI Mode booking — you have a transparency obligation. Your clients must know they are talking to AI, not a person.</p>

  <h2>What You Actually Need to Do</h2>

  <h3>1. Know What AI You Use</h3>
  <p>Make a simple list of every software tool in your salon. Check if it uses AI features (most will mention it in their marketing or settings). Common ones: Fresha, Booksy, Vagaro, GlossGenius, Boulevard, Zenoti, BookingBee, GoodCall, Timely.</p>

  <h3>2. Ensure AI Literacy (Required Since February 2025)</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4" target="_blank">Article 4 of the AI Act</a> requires that all staff and operators of AI systems have a sufficient level of AI literacy. For a salon, this means you and your team should understand the basics of how your AI tools work, what decisions they make, and what data they collect. This does not require a certification — a documented briefing or training session is sufficient.</p>

  <h3>3. Disclose AI Interactions to Clients</h3>
  <p>If your salon uses an AI receptionist, chatbot, or any AI that interacts with clients, you must clearly inform clients that they are communicating with an AI system. This can be as simple as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A message at the start of a chatbot conversation: "You are chatting with our AI assistant"</li>
    <li>A note on your website: "Phone calls may be answered by an AI receptionist"</li>
    <li>A disclosure in your booking confirmation: "This booking was processed by AI"</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Review Your Data Practices</h3>
  <p>AI tools that personalise marketing or store client preferences (like hair colour formulas) use personal data. Ensure your privacy policy covers AI processing and that you have a lawful basis under GDPR. Most salon software providers handle this through their own terms, but you should check.</p>

  <h3>5. Check Your Software Providers</h3>
  <p>The heaviest compliance obligations under the AI Act fall on the <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16" target="_blank">providers</a> (developers) of AI systems, not the <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-26" target="_blank">deployers</a> (users like you). Fresha, Booksy, and similar platforms are responsible for conformity assessments and technical documentation. But you should confirm your providers are aware of and preparing for AI Act compliance — ask them directly.</p>

  <h2>Can You Handle This Yourself?</h2>
  <p>For most hair salons, <strong>yes</strong>. The steps above are straightforward and do not require a consultant. If your salon only uses booking software and basic marketing tools, your compliance burden is light: know what you use, train your team, disclose AI to clients, and keep your privacy policy updated.</p>
  <p>You would need professional help if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You use AI to make decisions about staff (scheduling based on performance, automated roster changes)</li>
    <li>You use biometric AI (facial recognition for client check-in)</li>
    <li>You develop your own AI tools (custom recommendation engines, bespoke apps)</li>
    <li>You are unsure whether your AI tools fall into a higher risk category</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What "Compliant" Looks Like for a Salon</h2>
  <p>Picture this: you run a 6-chair salon using Fresha for bookings and BookingBee for after-hours phone handling. Here is what compliance looks like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have a one-page document listing all AI tools you use, their purpose, and their risk level</li>
    <li>Your staff have had a 30-minute briefing on what AI the salon uses and how it works</li>
    <li>Your website has a note that phone calls may be handled by AI</li>
    <li>Your BookingBee greeting includes "Hi, you have reached [salon name]'s AI assistant"</li>
    <li>Your privacy policy mentions AI-powered booking and marketing</li>
    <li>You have emailed Fresha and BookingBee asking for confirmation of their AI Act compliance readiness</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For most salons, that covers it. You are not being asked to hire a compliance team or register in an EU database. The obligations for minimal and limited risk AI are proportionate — they are designed to be manageable for businesses of any size.</p>

  <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>The EU AI Act does apply to your salon, but the requirements for the kind of AI most salons use are not onerous. The regulation is designed to be proportionate — a hair salon using Fresha is not treated the same as a hospital deploying diagnostic AI.</p>
  <p>What matters is awareness. Know what tools you use, understand what they do with your clients' data, make sure your team has a basic understanding, and be upfront with clients when AI is involved in their experience. That is a reasonable standard, and it is achievable without outside help for most salons.</p>
  <p>If you are unsure about any of it, or if your situation is more complex than what we have described here, it is worth speaking to someone who specialises in this area.</p>
