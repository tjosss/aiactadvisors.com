  <h1>GP Practices: Your AI Triage and Diagnostic Tools Are High-Risk Under the EU AI Act</h1>
  <p class="meta">February 2026 · 14 min read · <span style="background:var(--red-light);color:var(--red);padding:0.15rem 0.5rem;border-radius:4px;font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:600">HIGH-RISK · Industry Use Case</span></p>

  <p>General practice is one of the sectors most affected by the EU AI Act. AI triage tools, clinical decision support, diagnostic imaging, and medical transcription are now embedded in NHS and European GP workflows. Unlike a hair salon using an AI booking system or a restaurant with an AI phone line, healthcare AI directly affects patient safety — and the regulation treats it accordingly.</p>
  <p>Healthcare AI is explicitly high-risk under <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">Annex III</a> of the AI Act. If your practice uses AI for triage, diagnosis, or clinical decision-making, the compliance requirements are significant. Here is what you need to know.</p>

  <h2>The AI Tools GP Practices Actually Use</h2>

  <h3>AI Triage and Symptom Assessment</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://klinikhealthcaresolutions.com" target="_blank">Klinik</a></strong> is a CE-marked Class IIa medical device that provides AI-powered online triage for GP practices. It recognises over 1,000 symptoms and conditions, ranks urgency, and recommends whether patients need a GP, nurse, pharmacist, or self-care. NHS practices using Klinik have reported a 20 percent reduction in administrative tasks and &pound;350,000 in capacity savings per primary care network.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://econsult.net" target="_blank">eConsult</a></strong> powers triage for over 3,200 GP practices covering 28 million patients, with 50+ million consultations conducted. Their eTriage system uses AI aligned with the Manchester Triage System to auto-triage patients and suggest urgency levels.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://ada.com" target="_blank">Ada Health</a></strong>, UKCA-marked, is one of the most widely used patient-facing symptom checkers. Patients describe their symptoms and the AI evaluates possible conditions, recommending appropriate triage levels.</p>

  <h3>AI Clinical Decision Support</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://ardens.org.uk" target="_blank">Ardens Clinical</a></strong> is used by 87 percent of GP practices in England. It integrates with EMIS Web and SystmOne to provide clinical templates, safety alerts, recall systems, and referral management.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.iatrox.com" target="_blank">iatroX</a></strong> provides a UK-centric AI clinical assistant that answers questions against UK-accepted clinical guidance with explicit citations, supports structured differential diagnosis, and provides confidence metrics.</p>

  <h3>AI Medical Transcription and Documentation</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.animahealth.com" target="_blank">Anima</a></strong> (Annie AI Scribe) is an MHRA Class I registered medical device used by 400+ GP practices serving 2 million patients. It transcribes consultations in under 5 seconds, generates clinical notes with automatic SNOMED coding, and reads inbound hospital documents to create summaries and propose follow-up tasks. It integrates directly with EMIS and SystmOne.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.accurx.com" target="_blank">Accurx Scribe</a></strong> (powered by Tandem Health) has been rolled out to 98 percent of GP practices using the Accurx platform, reaching 200,000+ NHS staff. It transcribes consultations, generates structured medical notes, and creates patient and referral letters with EMIS and SystmOne write-back.</p>

  <h3>AI Diagnostic Imaging</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://skin-analytics.com" target="_blank">Skin Analytics DERM</a></strong> analyses skin lesion images with 97 percent sensitivity for skin cancer detection. It has assessed 170,000+ NHS patients. NICE has recommended it for conditional use in the urgent skin cancer pathway, with the important caveat that dermatologist second-reads are mandatory for patients with black or brown skin tones.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.skinvision.com" target="_blank">SkinVision</a></strong> is a CE-marked Class IIa medical device used by 3 million+ users globally, with 87 percent sensitivity in clinical studies (92.1 percent for melanoma).</p>

  <h3>AI Administrative Tools</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.betterletter.ai" target="_blank">BetterLetter</a></strong> processes inbound clinical letters, matches them to patients, highlights key diagnoses, and proposes SNOMED codes using a human-in-the-loop approach where clinical coders review and confirm. <strong><a href="https://www.accurx.com/booking" target="_blank">AccuRx Booking</a></strong> has enabled over 1 million patients to self-book appointments.</p>

  <h2>The Medical Device Overlap</h2>
  <p>Healthcare AI sits at the intersection of two regulatory frameworks: the EU AI Act and the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR). Many AI tools used in GP practices — Klinik (Class IIa), Skin Analytics, SkinVision, Anima (Class I) — are already regulated as medical devices. The AI Act adds a layer on top.</p>
  <p>For AI-enabled medical devices classified under MDR, providers must comply with both MDR requirements (conformity assessment, notified body involvement, CE marking) and AI Act requirements (risk management, data governance, transparency, human oversight). The compliance deadline for medical device AI is August 2027 — one year later than the general AI Act deadline.</p>
  <p>This dual regulatory burden falls primarily on the vendors who develop these tools, not on GP practices. But practices need to understand that the tools they deploy must meet both standards.</p>

  <h2>What GP Practices Need to Do</h2>

  <h3>1. Know What AI You Use</h3>
  <p>Map every AI tool in your practice: triage systems, clinical decision support, transcription, coding, imaging, booking. Note which are registered medical devices and which are not.</p>

  <h3>2. Ensure AI Literacy (Required Since February 2025)</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4" target="_blank">Article 4</a> requires that staff operating AI systems understand how they work. For a GP practice, this means clinicians using AI triage, transcription, or diagnostic tools should understand what the AI does, what data it uses, and critically, where its limitations are. This is especially important for diagnostic AI — NICE's recommendation of mandatory dermatologist second-reads for Skin Analytics DERM in patients with darker skin tones illustrates why understanding AI limitations matters.</p>

  <h3>3. Maintain Human Oversight</h3>
  <p>This is the most important obligation for healthcare AI. High-risk AI systems must operate under meaningful human oversight. In practice:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI triage recommendations should be reviewed by a clinician, not acted upon blindly</li>
    <li>AI diagnostic results (skin lesion analysis, imaging) require clinical confirmation</li>
    <li>AI-generated clinical notes and SNOMED codes should be reviewed before being saved to the patient record</li>
    <li>Patients must be able to see a human clinician if they disagree with or are concerned about an AI assessment</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Inform Patients</h3>
  <p>Patients must know when AI is being used in their care. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Online triage tools should clearly state they are AI-powered</li>
    <li>If a skin lesion is assessed by AI before a dermatologist reviews it, the patient should be informed</li>
    <li>If a consultation is being transcribed by AI, the patient should be told</li>
    <li>Patients should have a mechanism to request a fully human assessment</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Verify Your Vendors</h3>
  <p>The compliance burden sits primarily with the AI providers. But you should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm your AI tools hold appropriate regulatory status (CE marking, MHRA registration, DTAC compliance)</li>
    <li>Ask vendors about their EU AI Act compliance roadmap</li>
    <li>Ensure data processing agreements are in place (GDPR + AI Act)</li>
    <li>Subscribe to vendor safety alerts and updates</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Log and Report</h3>
  <p>For high-risk AI tools, maintain records of how the AI is used, document any incidents where the AI provided incorrect recommendations, and report serious incidents to the relevant authority (MHRA in the UK, notified bodies in the EU).</p>

  <h2>Can You Handle This Yourself?</h2>
  <p>Healthcare AI compliance is more involved than other industries covered in this series. While the technical compliance burden sits with your vendors, the deployer obligations — human oversight, patient information, incident logging, staff training — are more demanding for a GP practice than for a shop or salon.</p>
  <p>You would benefit from guidance if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You deploy AI triage that directly routes patients without clinical review</li>
    <li>You use AI diagnostic tools (imaging, skin analysis) in clinical pathways</li>
    <li>You are unsure whether your tools qualify as medical devices under MDR</li>
    <li>You want to formalise your AI governance and incident reporting processes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most GP practices will find that their vendors are already addressing the regulatory requirements. The practice's role is to use the tools responsibly, maintain human oversight, keep patients informed, and document their AI usage.</p>

  <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>Healthcare AI is where the EU AI Act has its most significant impact. Triage, diagnostics, and clinical decision support are explicitly high-risk, and the regulatory requirements reflect the potential consequences of getting it wrong. For GP practices, the key message is: your vendors must ensure their tools are compliant, but you must ensure the tools are used with appropriate human oversight, that patients are informed, and that your team understands the AI's capabilities and limitations.</p>
  <p>This is not optional or aspirational compliance. Patient safety AI carries the highest regulatory expectations under the EU AI Act, and for good reason.</p>
