  <h1>Restaurant Owners: Is Your AI Ordering System Compliant With the EU AI Act?</h1>
  <p class="meta">February 2026 · 11 min read · <span style="background:var(--gold-light);color:var(--gray-800);padding:0.15rem 0.5rem;border-radius:4px;font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:600">Industry Use Case</span></p>

  <p>You run a restaurant. You focus on food, service, and keeping customers happy. But if you use a modern point-of-sale system, an AI phone answering service, or dynamic pricing on your menu, you are already using AI — and the EU AI Act has something to say about it.</p>
  <p>The regulation, which comes fully into force in August 2026, applies to all businesses that <strong>deploy</strong> AI systems, not just those that develop them. That includes restaurants.</p>
  <p>Here is what you need to know.</p>

  <h2>The AI Tools Restaurants Actually Use</h2>
  <p>Restaurant technology has changed significantly in the past few years. Many of the platforms that restaurants rely on daily now include AI features — sometimes prominently marketed, sometimes quietly running in the background.</p>

  <h3>Point-of-Sale and Operations</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/products/toast-iq" target="_blank">Toast</a></strong> is one of the largest restaurant technology platforms, used by over <a href="https://investors.toasttab.com/news/news-details/2025/Toast-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank">127,000 locations</a> as of late 2024. Their <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/products/toast-iq" target="_blank">Toast IQ</a> platform uses AI to analyse sales data, identify trends, and provide actionable recommendations. Toast also offers AI-powered menu engineering that analyses item performance and suggests pricing changes, and predictive analytics for demand forecasting.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://get.popmenu.com/ai-answering" target="_blank">Popmenu</a></strong>, used by over 10,000 restaurants, offers an <a href="https://get.popmenu.com/ai-answering" target="_blank">AI Answering</a> feature that handles phone calls, answers questions about the menu, takes reservations, and processes orders — all without a human picking up the phone. Popmenu also uses AI for personalised marketing and dynamic menu recommendations.</p>

  <h3>Reservations and Guest Management</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://sevenrooms.com" target="_blank">SevenRooms</a></strong> uses AI to build detailed guest profiles, predict dining preferences, and automate personalised marketing based on visit history. Their platform segments guests automatically and triggers targeted campaigns. <strong>OpenTable</strong> and <strong>Resy</strong> also use AI for table management optimisation and demand prediction.</p>

  <h3>Labour and Inventory Forecasting</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.lineup.ai" target="_blank">Lineup.ai</a></strong> uses AI specifically for restaurant sales forecasting and labour scheduling. The platform analyses historical sales data, weather, local events, and other variables to predict how busy you will be and how many staff you need. <strong><a href="https://www.fourth.com" target="_blank">Fourth</a></strong> offers similar AI-powered workforce management and inventory forecasting for hospitality businesses.</p>

  <h3>Dynamic Pricing</h3>
  <p>Some restaurants have begun using AI-powered dynamic pricing — adjusting menu prices based on demand, time of day, or ingredient costs. This is more common in quick-service and delivery platforms, but it is spreading. Companies like <strong>Juicer</strong> (now part of Uber) and various delivery platforms use algorithmic pricing that changes in real time.</p>

  <h3>AI Phone Answering and Ordering</h3>
  <p>Beyond Popmenu, a growing number of services offer AI phone systems specifically for restaurants. <strong>Slang.ai</strong>, <strong>Maitre-D AI</strong>, and <strong>Presto</strong> (used by several large US chains) answer phones, handle takeaway orders, upsell, and manage reservations. These systems use natural language processing to understand callers and respond conversationally.</p>

  <h3>Kitchen and Food Safety AI</h3>
  <p>Tools like <strong>Apicbase</strong> and <strong>Winnow</strong> use AI for food waste tracking and recipe management. Winnow's AI-powered camera system identifies food waste in commercial kitchens and provides data to reduce costs. <strong>CookRight by Picadeli</strong> and similar systems use computer vision to monitor food preparation for safety and consistency.</p>

  <h2>What You Actually Need to Do</h2>

  <h3>1. Know What AI You Use</h3>
  <p>Go through your technology stack. Your POS system, reservation platform, phone system, marketing tools, scheduling software, and any delivery platform integrations. Check which ones use AI features. Most will mention it on their website or in their settings. Common restaurant platforms with AI: Toast, Popmenu, SevenRooms, OpenTable, Resy, Lineup.ai, Fourth, Square, Lightspeed.</p>

  <h3>2. Ensure AI Literacy (Required Since February 2025)</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4" target="_blank">Article 4 of the AI Act</a> requires that staff involved in operating AI systems understand the basics. For a restaurant, this means your managers and anyone handling the AI phone system, reservation platform, or scheduling tool should know what the AI does, what data it uses, and where its limitations are. A 30-minute documented briefing is sufficient.</p>

  <h3>3. Disclose AI Interactions to Customers</h3>
  <p>If your restaurant uses an AI phone system, chatbot, or any AI that interacts directly with customers, you must disclose this. Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your AI phone greeting: "Thank you for calling [restaurant]. You are speaking with our AI assistant."</li>
    <li>A note on your website: "Our phone line uses AI to handle reservations and orders"</li>
    <li>Your chatbot's opening message: "I am an AI assistant for [restaurant]. How can I help?"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is a transparency obligation under the AI Act. It applies to all AI systems that interact directly with people.</p>

  <h3>4. Be Careful With Staff Scheduling AI</h3>
  <p>This is where restaurants need to pay closer attention. If your scheduling tool simply forecasts demand and suggests how many staff you need, that is minimal risk. But if the AI is making decisions about <em>which</em> specific staff members work which shifts based on performance data, attendance patterns, or individual characteristics, it could cross into <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">Annex III Category 4</a> — the same high-risk category as recruitment AI.</p>
  <p>The distinction matters. Predicting "you need 4 servers on Friday" is different from "assign Maria to Friday because her performance score is highest." The second scenario involves AI making decisions about individual employment terms.</p>

  <h3>5. Review Your Data Practices</h3>
  <p>Guest profiling platforms like SevenRooms collect and process personal data. Ensure your privacy policy covers AI-powered processing, and that you have a lawful basis under GDPR. If you use loyalty programmes with AI personalisation, make sure customers can opt out.</p>

  <h3>6. Check Your Software Providers</h3>
  <p>As with any industry, the heaviest compliance burden falls on the <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16" target="_blank">providers</a> (the companies that build the AI), not the <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-26" target="_blank">deployers</a> (you). But you should ask your technology providers whether they are preparing for AI Act compliance. A simple email asking "What is your EU AI Act compliance roadmap?" is a good start.</p>

  <h2>Can You Handle This Yourself?</h2>
  <p>For most restaurants, yes. The majority of restaurant AI falls into the minimal or limited risk categories. The steps outlined above — identifying your AI tools, briefing your team, disclosing AI interactions, and checking with providers — are things you can do without a consultant.</p>
  <p>You would need professional guidance if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You use AI that makes decisions about individual staff members (scheduling, performance evaluation, task allocation)</li>
    <li>You use customer-facing AI that collects biometric data (facial recognition for loyalty, for example)</li>
    <li>You develop your own AI tools (custom ordering systems, proprietary recommendation engines)</li>
    <li>You operate across multiple EU jurisdictions and need to navigate different national implementations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What "Compliant" Looks Like for a Restaurant</h2>
  <p>Consider a busy city restaurant with 25 covers, using Toast for POS, Popmenu for AI phone answering, SevenRooms for reservations, and Lineup.ai for staff scheduling. Here is what compliance looks like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have a simple document listing all AI tools, their purpose, and their risk classification</li>
    <li>Your managers have had a 30-minute briefing on the AI tools the restaurant uses</li>
    <li>Your Popmenu AI phone greeting clearly states the caller is speaking with an AI assistant</li>
    <li>Your website mentions that phone calls and online ordering may be handled by AI</li>
    <li>Your privacy policy covers AI-powered guest profiling and marketing</li>
    <li>You have confirmed with your scheduling platform that AI only forecasts demand, not individual staff assignments based on performance</li>
    <li>You have emailed Toast, Popmenu, SevenRooms, and Lineup.ai asking about their AI Act compliance plans</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For most restaurants, that covers your obligations. The compliance effort is proportionate — a restaurant using AI for phone answering and demand forecasting is not held to the same standard as a hospital using AI for diagnostics or a bank using AI for credit decisions.</p>

  <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>Restaurant AI is growing fast. AI phone answering, demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, and guest personalisation are becoming standard features in restaurant technology platforms. The EU AI Act applies to all of these, but for most restaurants, the obligations are manageable.</p>
  <p>The key actions are straightforward: know what AI you use, make sure your team understands the basics, tell customers when they are interacting with AI, and confirm your software providers are preparing for compliance. If your situation is more complex — particularly around staff management AI — it is worth getting advice from someone who specialises in this area.</p>
