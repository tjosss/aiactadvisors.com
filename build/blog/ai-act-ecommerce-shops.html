  <h1>E-Commerce Shops: What the EU AI Act Means for Your Online Store</h1>
  <p class="meta">February 2026 · 12 min read · <span style="background:var(--gold-light);color:var(--gray-800);padding:0.15rem 0.5rem;border-radius:4px;font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:600">Industry Use Case</span></p>

  <p>If you sell online, you use AI. Product recommendations, chatbots, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, personalised emails — these are standard features in modern e-commerce platforms. The EU AI Act, which comes fully into force in August 2026, applies to businesses that deploy AI systems. That includes your online shop.</p>
  <p>The good news is that most e-commerce AI falls into the minimal or limited risk categories. But there is one area where the regulation bites hard: if your shop offers buy now, pay later services like Klarna or Afterpay, the AI credit scoring behind those payments is explicitly high-risk.</p>
  <p>Here is what you need to know.</p>

  <h2>The AI Tools E-Commerce Businesses Actually Use</h2>

  <h3>Product Recommendations</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.nosto.com/" target="_blank">Nosto</a></strong> uses behavioural and predictive AI to deliver personalised product suggestions in real time. Their platform runs 20+ self-learning algorithms for cross-sells, upsells, and "visually similar" product recommendations. Nosto integrates with Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce, and Shopware.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.clerk.io/" target="_blank">Clerk.io</a></strong>, founded in Copenhagen, provides an all-in-one AI personalisation platform with 20+ recommendation logics. Customers report a 22 percent increase in average basket size from their recommendations. <strong><a href="https://www.mastercard.com/europe/en/business/consumer-acquisition-and-engagement/personalization/how-it-works.html" target="_blank">Dynamic Yield</a></strong> (now owned by Mastercard) powers personalisation for 350+ global brands.</p>

  <h3>AI Chatbots and Customer Service</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.gorgias.com/" target="_blank">Gorgias</a></strong>, used by 15,000 e-commerce brands, offers an AI Agent that resolves 60 percent of support enquiries automatically. Their 2026 update includes a Shopping Assistant that proactively engages customers with personalised recommendations and intent-based discounting.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.tidio.com/" target="_blank">Tidio</a></strong> serves over 300,000 businesses with live chat and its Lyro AI chatbot that automates common questions, order status checks, and ticket creation. Both platforms integrate deeply with Shopify and other major e-commerce systems.</p>

  <h3>Dynamic Pricing</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://prisync.com/" target="_blank">Prisync</a></strong> monitors competitor prices in real time and generates AI-driven SmartPrice suggestions based on competitor pricing and your product costs. <strong><a href="https://competera.ai/" target="_blank">Competera</a></strong> handles AI pricing for large retailers including Sephora, MediaMarkt, and Ocado, updating thousands of SKUs multiple times daily.</p>

  <h3>Inventory and Demand Forecasting</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.prediko.io/" target="_blank">Prediko</a></strong>, used by 1,000+ Shopify merchants, trains its AI on 25 million+ SKUs across 15 industries. It analyses seasonality, past sales, and growth trends to predict demand, flag low stock, and generate purchase orders automatically.</p>

  <h3>Fraud Detection</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.signifyd.com/" target="_blank">Signifyd</a></strong> provides AI-powered fraud decisions with a financial guarantee against chargebacks on approved orders. Their system analyses transaction patterns to make instant checkout decisions, claiming a 5-9 percent conversion increase. <strong><a href="https://www.riskified.com/" target="_blank">Riskified</a></strong> offers similar AI fraud protection for high-volume retailers.</p>
  <p>Shopify includes built-in machine learning fraud analysis that flags unusual orders based on IP address, payment method, and order patterns, though many merchants supplement this with dedicated tools.</p>

  <h3>AI Email Marketing and Personalisation</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/" target="_blank">Klaviyo</a></strong>, used by 117,000+ brands with Shopify, includes 40+ AI-powered features: optimised send times based on subscriber engagement, AI-generated subject lines, churn prediction, and next-purchase-date forecasting. It personalises product recommendations across email, SMS, and WhatsApp.</p>

  <h3>AI-Generated Product Descriptions</h3>
  <p>Tools like <strong><a href="https://describely.ai/" target="_blank">Describely</a></strong> generate SEO-optimised product descriptions in bulk, syncing with Shopify, Wix, and Salsify. This is increasingly common as merchants scale their catalogues faster than they can write descriptions manually.</p>

  <h2>The Buy Now, Pay Later Question</h2>
  <p>This is the part of e-commerce AI that crosses into high-risk territory. If your shop offers Klarna, Afterpay, Clearpay, or similar buy now, pay later (BNPL) services, the AI credit scoring that decides whether a customer is approved happens in the background — but it is explicitly covered by <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3" target="_blank">Annex III, Section 5</a> of the AI Act, which classifies AI for "evaluating the creditworthiness of natural persons or establishing their credit score" as high-risk.</p>
  <p>The compliance burden here falls primarily on the BNPL providers (Klarna, Afterpay, etc.), not on you as the merchant. They are the <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16" target="_blank">providers</a> of the AI system. However, as a <a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-26" target="_blank">deployer</a>, you should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inform customers that BNPL decisions involve AI credit assessment</li>
    <li>Ensure your BNPL providers are preparing for AI Act compliance</li>
    <li>Provide a process for customers to query BNPL decisions (most providers already handle this)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What You Actually Need to Do</h2>

  <h3>1. Know What AI You Use</h3>
  <p>Go through your technology stack: your e-commerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento), recommendation engine, chatbot, email marketing, fraud detection, pricing tools, and payment providers. List which ones use AI features. Most will mention it in their marketing or settings.</p>

  <h3>2. Ensure AI Literacy (Required Since February 2025)</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4" target="_blank">Article 4</a> requires that staff operating AI systems understand the basics of how they work. If you run the shop yourself, that means you. If you have a team, ensure they understand which customer interactions are AI-powered and what data the AI processes.</p>

  <h3>3. Disclose AI Interactions to Customers</h3>
  <p>If you use an AI chatbot for customer service, customers must know they are talking to AI. This is straightforward — most chatbot platforms already include an option to display an "AI assistant" label. For AI-generated product descriptions, consider adding a note if descriptions are not reviewed by a human.</p>

  <h3>4. Review Your Dynamic Pricing</h3>
  <p>Standard competitive pricing based on market data is minimal risk. But if your pricing AI applies different prices to different customer segments based on personal data — for example, showing higher prices to customers identified as less price-sensitive — you should review whether this could be considered discriminatory. The AI Act does not explicitly classify this as high-risk, but it intersects with existing consumer protection rules.</p>

  <h3>5. Check Your Payment Providers</h3>
  <p>If you offer BNPL, confirm that your providers (Klarna, Afterpay, Clearpay, etc.) are preparing for high-risk AI compliance. Ask them directly about their AI Act compliance roadmap.</p>

  <h3>6. Check All Your Software Providers</h3>
  <p>The heaviest obligations fall on the providers of AI systems, not on you as a deployer. But you should confirm your key providers are aware of the AI Act. A simple email asking "Are you preparing for EU AI Act compliance?" to Nosto, Clerk.io, Gorgias, Tidio, Klaviyo, or whichever tools you use is a reasonable step.</p>

  <h2>Can You Handle This Yourself?</h2>
  <p>For most small-to-medium e-commerce businesses, yes. The majority of your AI tools fall into minimal or limited risk categories. The steps above — mapping your AI, briefing yourself or your team, labelling chatbots, checking with providers — are all things you can do without a consultant.</p>
  <p>You would need professional guidance if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You develop your own AI tools (custom recommendation engines, proprietary pricing algorithms)</li>
    <li>You use AI to make decisions that affect individual customers' access to services (beyond standard personalisation)</li>
    <li>You process biometric data for customer identification</li>
    <li>You operate a BNPL or credit service directly (rather than through a third-party provider)</li>
    <li>You sell across multiple EU jurisdictions and need to navigate different national implementations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What "Compliant" Looks Like for an Online Shop</h2>
  <p>Consider a Shopify store with 500 orders per month, using Nosto for recommendations, Tidio for chat, Klaviyo for email, Shopify's built-in fraud analysis, and Klarna for BNPL. Here is what compliance looks like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have a simple document listing all AI tools, their purpose, and risk level</li>
    <li>You understand how each tool uses customer data</li>
    <li>Your Tidio chatbot displays "AI assistant" in the chat window</li>
    <li>Your privacy policy mentions AI-powered recommendations, chatbot, and email personalisation</li>
    <li>Your checkout page notes that Klarna decisions involve AI credit assessment</li>
    <li>You have confirmed with Klarna that they are preparing for AI Act compliance</li>
    <li>You have emailed Nosto, Tidio, and Klaviyo about their AI Act compliance plans</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For most online shops, that is the extent of it. The regulation is designed to be proportionate — a Shopify store using product recommendations is not treated the same as a bank using AI for loan decisions.</p>

  <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>E-commerce AI is largely low-risk under the EU AI Act. Product recommendations, email personalisation, inventory forecasting, and fraud detection are all minimal risk. Chatbots require transparency (tell customers it is AI). The one area that crosses into high-risk is BNPL credit scoring, but the compliance burden there sits primarily with the payment providers, not with you as the merchant.</p>
  <p>The key actions: know what AI you use, tell customers when they are interacting with AI, check that your BNPL providers are preparing for compliance, and keep your privacy policy updated. If your setup is more complex, speak to a specialist.</p>
